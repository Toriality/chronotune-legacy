          <h1>The Music in Chronotune</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            One of the unique aspects of Chronotune is its broad music selection. The game
            features songs from the Spotify's database, meaning you'll get millions of
            different songs each time you play Chronotune!
          </p>
          <p>
            We build a special algorithm for Chronotune that filters off most of the
            invalid songs like AudioBooks and Podcasts, that way, you'll get the best
            experience possible while playing.
